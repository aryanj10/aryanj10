# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Aryan Jain

Welcome to my GitHub profile â€” a space where data meets direction and models (mostly) behave.

## ðŸ§  About Me

I'm currently pursuing my **Masterâ€™s in Data Science** at **Drexel University**, graduating in June 2025. With **2+ years of industry experience**, Iâ€™ve worked across data analytics, machine learning, and AI deployment. My goal is to build systems that are explainable, efficient, and impactful.

Along the way, Iâ€™ve:

â€¢ Automated analytics workflows that save hours of manual work  
â€¢ Forecasted financial KPIs for over 178 QSR stores using time series models  
â€¢ Built dashboards and tools that help teams act on data quickly  
â€¢ Applied SHAP and LIME to make complex models more transparent  
â€¢ Deployed ML models with NVIDIA Triton for real-time inference

## ðŸ”§ What I Work On

â€¢ Business and Financial Analytics: P&L insights, store clustering, EBITDA drivers  
â€¢ Explainable AI: SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, meta-explainers  
â€¢ ML Deployment: Triton Inference Server, FastAPI, batch and real-time pipelines  

### Projects:  
  - **Comcast AI in Entertainment Challenge** : Created an end-to-end AI-generated animated movie using GenAI tools like META AI, Stable Diffusion, voice cloning, and video editing. ðŸŽ¥ [Watch here](https://youtu.be/fCD2pDRNmc8?si=88W_GiLR8DaFo56D)
  - **Triton Inference Deployment** : Built a scalable inference pipeline using NVIDIA Triton Server for deploying image classification models
  - **Store Financial Dashboard** : Built interactive dashboards to visualize revenue, cost, and EBITDA metrics across 178 QSR stores
  - **Philly Crime Analysis** : Analyzed historical crime data to predict patterns and visualize incidents using time-series and spatial clustering
  - **Resume Editor + PDF Generator** : Developed a web-based tool to edit JSON resumes and render LaTeX-based professional PDFs
  - **Reddit-based Political Influence Analysis** : Investigated ideological spread and key influencers in Redditâ€™s political subcommunities using network analysis

## ðŸ’¬ A Quick Personal Note

I care deeply about building meaningful, data-driven solutions â€” whether itâ€™s for predicting crime trends, improving financial access, or making AI explainable. And yes, I still get a small kick every time I debug something thatâ€™s been stuck for hours.

Also, Iâ€™m a Microsoft Certified Azure Data Scientist Associate and Azure AI Engineer Associate.
