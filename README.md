# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Aryan Jain

Welcome to my GitHub profile â€” a space where data meets direction and models (mostly) behave.

## ðŸ§  About Me

I'm currently pursuing my **Masterâ€™s in Data Science** at **Drexel University**, graduating in June 2025. With **2+ years of industry experience**, Iâ€™ve worked across data analytics, machine learning, and AI deployment. My goal is to build systems that are explainable, efficient, and impactful.

Along the way, Iâ€™ve:

â€¢ Automated analytics workflows that save hours of manual work  
â€¢ Forecasted financial KPIs for over 178 QSR stores using time series models  
â€¢ Built dashboards and tools that help teams act on data quickly  
â€¢ Applied SHAP and LIME to make complex models more transparent  
â€¢ Deployed ML models with NVIDIA Triton for real-time inference

## ðŸ”§ What I Work On

â€¢ Business and Financial Analytics: P&L insights, store clustering, EBITDA drivers  
â€¢ Explainable AI: SHAP, LIME, Grad-CAM, meta-explainers  
â€¢ ML Deployment: Triton Inference Server, FastAPI, batch and real-time pipelines  
â€¢ Projects:  
  â€¢ AI-powered credit scoring using cash flow data  
  â€¢ Reddit-based political influence analysis with NetworkX  
  â€¢ Insider trading detection using NLP and GNN  
  â€¢ Personal investment planner with portfolio optimization

## ðŸ’¬ A Quick Personal Note

I care deeply about building meaningful, data-driven solutions â€” whether itâ€™s for predicting crime trends, improving financial access, or making AI explainable. And yes, I still get a small kick every time I debug something thatâ€™s been stuck for hours.
